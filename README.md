## Abstract
Fall detection in elderly individuals is a critical necessity, especially in domestic environments, due to the severe health and quality-of-life impacts associated with such events. This paper presents the development of a robust computer vision-based system implemented using Python and libraries such as YOLOv8 and MediaPipe, integrated with commercially available indoor security cameras. The system aims not only to efficiently detect falls but also to identify imminent risk situations, enabling rapid and effective interventions.

The implementation includes real-time notifications to caregivers via Telegram, facilitating agile and priority-driven responses. Additionally, the system employs temporal confirmation techniques and anatomical analysis to reduce false positives, increasing reliability and efficiency in detecting critical events. This approach prioritizes non-invasiveness, high accuracy, and low latency, addressing challenges such as hardware limitations and network infrastructure constraints. Local processing ensures privacy and compliance with regulations such as the LGPD. Preliminary tests demonstrated the effectiveness of the architecture, showcasing its significant potential for scalability in home applications.

## **1. Introduction**  

Falls among elderly individuals are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality, often resulting in frequent hospitalizations and long-term complications. According to Siqueira et al. (2011), approximately 25% of elderly Brazilians living in urban areas experience falls annually. High-risk locations include bedrooms (29%), living rooms (19.6%), and bathrooms (14.5%), where obstacles, slippery floors, and the lack of adequate adaptations exacerbate the risk (Vieira et al., 2018).  

For elderly individuals with dementia, the risk of falling is significantly elevated. Namoos et al. (2024) report that patients with Alzheimer’s disease have a threefold greater likelihood of experiencing falls due to cognitive deficits, balance impairments, and disorientation. Such events not only lead to severe injuries, such as fractures, but also negatively impact quality of life by inducing fear, social isolation, and functional dependency (Nascimento & Duarte, 2018).  

The increasing demand for continuous care and the inadequacy of existing infrastructure underscore the urgent need for accessible and effective technological solutions. This study introduces a computer vision-based system designed to monitor elderly individuals in real-time, detect falls, and issue preventative alerts. The system emphasizes privacy, accessibility, and adaptability to domestic environments with limited infrastructure.  

By integrating computer vision technologies with low-latency communication networks, this approach aims to revolutionize home care. It has the potential to significantly reduce response times in emergency situations, enhancing the safety and quality of life for both elderly individuals and their caregivers.

## **2. Literature Review**  

Computer vision applied to fall detection has significantly advanced with the development of deep learning models. Libraries such as YOLO (You Only Look Once) have gained widespread use due to their efficiency in real-time object detection, offering high precision and low latency (Redmon et al., 2016; Jocher et al., 2023). Similarly, MediaPipe provides robust capabilities for human pose tracking, enabling detailed analysis of body movements (Lugaresi et al., 2019).  

Challenges such as latency and hardware limitations are persistent in home-based systems. Studies by Camponogara et al. (2021) demonstrated that local processing optimizations could reduce latency by up to 40%. Moreover, Carvalho et al. (2017) highlighted that Brazil's network infrastructure often exhibits inconsistencies, which negatively impact connectivity-dependent solutions.  

The need for systems that balance precision, cost, and privacy is emphasized by Victor (2024), who underscores the importance of hybrid solutions and local processing. Recent research has also explored the integration of multisensory data into computer vision solutions, such as inertial sensors and microphones, to complement visual detection in challenging conditions.  

This study seeks to address these gaps by proposing an architecture based on affordable hardware and optimized algorithms for domestic environments. Furthermore, the review highlights the importance of validating these solutions through clinical trials to ensure their effectiveness and acceptance by end-users.

### **3.2 Latency Measurement**  

Latency tests were conducted to evaluate the time required for image acquisition and transmission from the camera to the processing system.  

#### **1. Environment Setup**  
- The camera was connected to a local server in a simulated real-world environment using an Ethernet-equivalent connection (RJ-45).  
- Processing relied solely on the CPU without dedicated GPU support.  

#### **2. Measurement Process**  
- For each frame, the start timestamp was recorded when the capture command was issued.  
- The end timestamp was recorded when the frame was fully transferred to system memory.  
- The difference between these timestamps represented the image acquisition latency for each frame.  

#### **3. Sampling and Statistical Analysis**  
- A total of eleven measurements were conducted to capture latency values.  
- Results included individual measurements, as well as minimum, maximum, and average latency values.  

#### **4. Test Scope**  
- These tests were designed solely to measure the initial latency of image acquisition.  
- Additional processing steps, such as skeletal pose estimation or facial and body recognition, were excluded at this stage.  

#### **Results**  
- **Network Latency:** 8.5 ms (average).  
- **Image Acquisition Latency (RTSP over Wi-Fi):**  
  - **Average:** 843.170 ms  
  - **Minimum:** 771.599 ms  
  - **Maximum:** 908.776 ms  

#### **Observations**  
The image acquisition latencies were comparable to those observed in Ethernet-connected environments. However, these initial tests only measured the acquisition window, excluding subsequent processing stages that will include:  
1. **Skeletal Pose Estimation:** Identifying body positions and movements.  
2. **Facial and Body Recognition:** Analyzing and recognizing individual faces and body features.  
3. **Risk Analysis:** Assessing movement patterns to classify potential risks.  
4. **Alert Notification:** Triggering caregiver notifications.  

Future testing will incorporate these processing components to generate a complete performance evaluation.

### **3.3 Risk Classification**  

Monitored events are classified into five risk levels based on motion analysis:  

- **Low:** Normal movement without signs of instability.  
- **Moderate:** Attempting to stand up.  
- **High:** Standing posture with a risk of falling.  
- **Emergency:** Confirmed fall.  
- **Alert:** Leaving the monitored area.  

---

### **3.4 Data Processing**  

To ensure robust detection, the system incorporates temporal confirmation, anatomical analysis, and privacy safeguards:  

#### **1. Temporal Confirmation**  
- Falls are confirmed if the individual remains in a prone position for at least **1 second**, minimizing false positives from rapid movements or position adjustments.  
- Risk levels classified as moderate or high require a minimum duration of **3 seconds** before generating alerts, ensuring a more precise assessment of critical behavior.  
- The system dynamically adjusts the number of frames needed for validation based on frame rate and scene complexity, considering factors like low lighting or increased activity levels.  

#### **2. Anatomical Analysis**  
- Skeletal data is used to differentiate normal activities (e.g., sitting or lying down) from anomalous events such as falls or risky postures.  
- Relationships between body segments are analyzed to detect abnormal patterns, such as excessive trunk inclination, shoulder misalignment, or irregular leg movements.  
- The system evaluates body trajectory over frame sequences to identify abrupt shifts that indicate potential imbalance (e.g., rapid transition from vertical to horizontal).  
- Observed patterns are compared against a reference database built from longitudinal studies, enabling system adaptation to individual health conditions and context-specific behaviors, such as neurological impairments affecting motor control.  

#### **3. Privacy Compliance**  
- Only inferred skeletal data and motion patterns are processed, ensuring complete anonymization and compliance with privacy regulations, such as LGPD.
